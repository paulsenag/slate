# Field Vision

Welcome to the Field Vision functional documentation. At it's core, Field Vision is an integrated lead/contact management system. Within these pages, we describe the various pieces of functionality needed to create the Field Vision web application. 

Field Vision is to be designed architecturally as a second version of the ["Genny"](http://sgt.int.lamp.pmcdev.com/) proof of concept. Within the core of the platform, sales team members can update a potential lead based off of default criteria, which is outlined in detail later on within this documentation. In this mode, it can be best thought of as a contact management system. The power of Field Vision really shines though when integrated with data from third party marketing data providers, such as the network of Farm Journals and integration with a marketing automation platform, Sharp Spring.
